This repository contains my Networking Basics for Cybersecurity task, focusing on fundamental networking concepts and analyzing network traffic using Wireshark. The work covers essential network-level security concepts such as IP and MAC addresses, DNS, TCP/UDP protocols, packet capture, filtering, and traffic analysis.

📄 Contents
- Introduction to Networking Basics in Cybersecurity
- IP and MAC addresses – device identification and addressing
- DNS – resolving domain names to IP addresses
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) – reliable data transmission
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol) – fast, connectionless data transmission
- Packet captures and filtering using Wireshark (HTTP, DNS, TCP)
- TCP Three-Way Handshake – understanding connection establishment
- Plain-text vs Encrypted traffic – identifying secure and insecure communication
- DNS Queries – analyzing domain access patterns
- Saving packet captures for future analysis and forensic purposes

🔍 Learning & Research Sources Referred
- Wireshark Documentation – for packet capturing and analysis
- GeeksforGeeks – for networking concepts and protocol understanding
- Google – for additional research and clarification

🧠 Tools Used
- Wireshark – network protocol analyzer
- Windows – for testing network traffic
- Browser / Internet – for research and references

🎓 Purpose
- This work is part of my academic learning to understand networking fundamentals in cybersecurity. The task helped me gain practical knowledge of network traffic analysis, protocol behavior, and techniques used to monitor, secure, and investigate networks using Wireshark.
